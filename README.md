# Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
Depository for C sharp practice projects
This depository is to be used for C# projects associated with the course.

So far I have learned C# syntax and Object model, and can create simple MVC applicatoins to interact with SQL database.
This depository contains my projects:
- A newsletter program that can add users through a html form into a local database.
- An overhaul version of this, using .net data framework
- A classic Blackjack game, mostly meant to demonstrate Class OOP of C#
- A project to code-first create database (using C# class model as template and transform into database)
- A car insurance quote program, demonstrating MVC concept and view control.
